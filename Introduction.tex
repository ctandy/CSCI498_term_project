\section{Introduction}
 The Microsoft Kinect sensor added a new dimension to gaming by giving users the ability to play games using only their body as the controller. This allows users to play games either completely independent of a physical controller or still with a physical controller but augmented by gestures. For our project, we attemped to recreate the game control interface between a Kinect and a game. Specifically, our application aimed to allow a player to control the keyboard-based game called Space Invaders using their body and predefined gestures. To do this, we sought to utilize a machine-learning technique we learned in class called standard vector machines (SVMs). The goal was to first use SVMs to classify and create a model of the the gameplay gestures - effectively training the application to recognize the gestures - then, use this model to predict against (recognize) gestures from skeletal data live-streamed from the Kinect. By binding keyboard inputs to these gestures, we would able to play the game using real-time gesture recognition. A more in-depth explanation of our approach can be found in the next section.
