\section{Approach}
We decided to approach the problem by breaking it down into three smaller subproblems: raw data acquisition, production of models for use with libSVM, and gesture matching. The first two deal with specifying the gestures that were ultimately used in the system, while the last actually recognized them. Each of these subproblems was dealt with by its own program, which we will detail here.
