\section{Conclusion}
The goal of our project was to create an interface between the Kinect and a game using machine-learning techniques we learned in class to allow gameplay controlled by gestures. While the accuracy of our implementation was not at the level we were hoping for, in the end it does accomplish what it was meant to do. Using the application we built alongside a Kinect, we are able to play the game Space Invaders using gestures we trained the application to recognize. Some ways we could improve the accuracy of gesture recognition would be to use a larger training set, as noted earlier, and to experiment with different skeletal representations. For example, since, aside from the neutral position, our gestures involve only variations of the hands, we might see more distinct classification and therefore more accurate recognition if we were to use only the hands in our representation and the chest as the centroid joint. Another improvement would be to integrate the game directly into our application so the user does not have to open a game separately.
