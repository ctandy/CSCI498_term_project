For this project, we were asked to apply techniques we learned in class to develop software packages for human-centered robotics or other intelligent machines. To meet these requirements, our team decided to develop an application to interface between a Kinect sensor and the keyboard. This would allow a person to use their body to act as a controller for normally keyboard-controlled games and thus control the game using gestures. In this paper, we first introduce our application and an overview of the implementation. Next, we describe the approaches we used to develop our application and the reasoning behind them. Then, we describe experiments we used to evaluate our approach followed by a presentation of the data and an analysis of the results. Finally, we give a conclusion including a brief summary of our project, possible improvements we could make in the future, and any notable findings.
